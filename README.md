# ToonTanks
This is a 3D game created in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course. The game features a level with enemy towers shooting a player tank.

Here are some specific things I learned while making this game:

- Custom Pawn class for the Tank and Towers.
- New Enhanced Input system usage for the player controller with custom input actions and input mapping context.
- Tank movement using player input
- Projectiles spawning on Tank/Tower shooting
- Health, damage and destruction logic
- Simple HUD with start/end game messages
- Special effects: smoke, explosions
- Sounds on fire and destroy
- Camera shake effect
